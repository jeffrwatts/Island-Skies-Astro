# Processing Deep Sky Images

Processing is where the magic happens in astrophotography. Here's my workflow for creating stunning deep sky images.

## Software Stack

I use a combination of specialized astronomy software:

- **PixInsight**: For calibration, stacking, and advanced processing
- **Adobe Photoshop**: For final touches and color grading
- **DeepSkyStacker**: Alternative stacking software for beginners

## Basic Workflow

### 1. Calibration
- Dark frames to remove thermal noise
- Flat frames to correct vignetting
- Bias frames for sensor read noise

### 2. Stacking
- Align and combine multiple exposures
- Reject outliers and hot pixels
- Increase signal-to-noise ratio

### 3. Processing
- Stretch the histogram to reveal faint details
- Apply noise reduction
- Enhance contrast and color saturation

## Tips for Success

- Take plenty of calibration frames
- Use consistent exposure settings
- Process in small steps
- Save intermediate results

Remember, processing is an art form. Don't be afraid to experiment!
