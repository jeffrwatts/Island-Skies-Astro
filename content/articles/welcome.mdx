# Welcome to Island Skies Astro

Welcome to my astrophotography gallery! This site showcases my journey capturing the cosmos from the beautiful skies of Hawaii.

## Why Hawaii?

Living in Hawaii has given me access to some of the darkest skies in the world. The combination of high altitude observing sites like Mauna Kea and the stable atmospheric conditions make this an ideal location for astrophotography.

## What You'll Find Here

This gallery features:

- **Deep Sky Objects**: Galaxies, nebulae, and star clusters
- **Planetary Images**: Detailed views of planets in our solar system
- **Equipment Reviews**: Thoughts on telescopes, cameras, and accessories
- **Technique Articles**: Processing tips and imaging techniques

## Getting Started

If you're new to astrophotography, I recommend starting with:

1. A good equatorial mount
2. A refractor telescope (80-100mm aperture)
3. A DSLR or dedicated astronomy camera
4. Patience and persistence!

The night sky is waiting to be captured. Clear skies!
